# How to Run Streamlit Dashboard

This is a brief guide to running the Streamlit dashboard. Make sure you have installed all the required libraries before running the application. You can ignore the ipynb file because I only used it for comprehensive data cleaning and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) before creating the data dashboard.

## Install Dependencies

To install all the required libraries, open your terminal/command prompt, navigate to this project folder, and run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Dashboard
```bash
cd dashboard
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
## View Dashboard Directly
In the data dashboard, you can directly observe the air pollution trends, starting from PM2.5 particles, PM10 particles, Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Ozone (O3) concentrations at each station. The larger the values of these compounds, the worse the air quality. Additionally, this dashboard also provides information on how to protect oneself from air pollution.
