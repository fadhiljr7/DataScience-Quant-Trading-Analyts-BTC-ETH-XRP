# How to Run Streamlit Dashboard

This is a brief guide to running the Streamlit dashboard. Make sure you have installed all the required libraries before running the application. You can ignore the ipynb file because I only used it for comprehensive data cleaning and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) before creating the data dashboard.

## Install Dependencies

To install all the required libraries, open your terminal/command prompt, navigate to this project folder, and run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Dashboard
```bash
cd dashboard
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
## View Dashboard Directly
On the data dashboard, you can directly observe the comparison of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) starting from December 2017 to September 2023. It provides a summary of quant trading analysis for these three cryptocurrencies, along with four charts illustrating their price developments/growth. There is also a chart depicting the relationship between cryptocurrency prices and their trading volume, etc.
